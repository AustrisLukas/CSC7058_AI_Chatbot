The Washington Post Publisher and Chief Executive Will Lewis announced Saturday evening he would depart after just two years at the paper, a tenure marked by controversy and crisis.

Lewis called his time "two years of transformation" in his resignation note, but it was defined by turbulence rather than a clear path, and it ended with brutal job cuts. The paper's chief financial officer, Jeff D'Onofrio, will serve as acting CEO.

More than a third of the newsroom was laid off Wednesday after Lewis' promises of radical innovations failed to staunch several years of annual losses in the tens of millions of dollars. At one point, losses hit $100 million, Lewis told staffers in June 2024 during a rocky newsroom all-staff. The session occurred just five months into his time at the Post. Yet it proved to be his final all-staff meeting.

He was effectively AWOL as the paper's scope, ambitions and journalism were radically redefined and constricted. Lewis played no visible role in announcing the layoffs in a mandatory Zoom call for the newsroom on Wednesday. Nor did he publicly address the paper's readers to allay their concerns.

The coup de grâce came just a day later when Lewis was photographed in Northern California walking a red carpet at a Super Bowl event.

The newsroom had lost so much faith in Lewis that, in recent weeks, journalists appealed directly in letters to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the paper's owner, to spare the paper from cuts and help it find financial stability. Bezos did not respond to those appeals.

As NPR has previously reported, the sports desk was eliminated; the local news staff reduced to about a dozen from more than 40; the international desk decimated. Among the layoffs: the entire Middle East team, the Ukraine bureau chief and another war correspondent. The latter posted she received the email informing her of her job loss while she was in a war zone.

Executive Editor Matt Murray told staffers on Wednesday he hopes the paper will maintain a "presence" in 12 locations around the globe. Four people with knowledge of the still-evolving plans say that presence is likely to rely significantly on local stringers. (They declined to speak on the record as the precise details of who is to be retained had yet to be resolved.) Lewis, Murray and Bezos have declined comment about the layoffs through their spokespersons.

Murray told staffers the paper will focus on U.S. politics and national security as well as health, wellness, and other subjects in which readers have shown strong interest. The newsroom will stand at about 500 people.

Bezos promised an exciting and thriving next chapter for the paper in a statement issued by the company Saturday evening. It is his first public comment in some time.

"The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity," Bezos wrote. "Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus."

In the same press release, the new CEO paid homage to the newspaper's legacy.

"The Post's resolute commitment to writing the first rough draft of history anchors and imprints its future," said D'Onofrio, the new chief executive and publisher. "I am honored to become part of charting that future and to take the lead in securing both the legacy and business of this fierce, storied American institution."

"Something I will be most proud of"

Bezos, one of the wealthiest people on the planet, had been hailed as a savior when he bought the Post from the Graham family in 2013. The newspaper was falling into the same cycle of decline that had afflicted so many metro dailies.

And he said it would be a generational investment.

"My stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of when I'm 90 and reviewing my life," Bezos wrote in 2019, when his personal life became the subject of tabloid fodder.

He invested deeply in the company and promised not to intervene in news coverage, despite his vast business interests. And, he never did — despite the fact that his vast business interests could be the subject of news reports — according to several current and former senior news executives, including Marty Baron. Baron, who led the paper to great heights in covering President Trump's first term, wrote in his memoir that the paper enjoyed six straight years of profits.

The approach came at a cost to Bezos: Trump, who often denounced the paper as the "Amazon Washington Post," took umbrage when Amazon was expected to land a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon. Microsoft won it again; Amazon sued, claiming Trump had interfered.

The case was ultimately settled after the Pentagon split the contract among four companies, including Amazon, but its take was far smaller.

The Post's profits turned to losses and Bezos's approach changed. When it became clear in summer 2023 that former Post Publisher Fred Ryan did not have the answers to growing red ink, Bezos forced him out.
